**A robust CI/CD pipeline for an automated resume builder web application, leveraging Jenkins for continuous integration and Docker for containerization.**

</div>

## 📖 Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive solution for an "Automated Resume Builder" web application, primarily focusing on establishing a fully automated Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline using **Jenkins** and **Docker**. The project demonstrates best practices in DevOps, enabling developers to automatically build, test, containerize, and prepare for deployment of the resume builder application upon code changes.

The core of the project involves a modern JavaScript web application (the resume builder itself) and a robust Jenkins pipeline (`Jenkinsfile`) that orchestrates the entire CI/CD workflow, from dependency installation and testing to Docker image creation. This setup ensures high code quality, rapid iteration, and reliable deployment processes for the resume building tool.

## ✨ Features

-   **Automated CI/CD Pipeline**: Full automation of build, test, and containerization using Jenkins.
-   **Docker Containerization**: Packaging the resume builder application into a lightweight, portable Docker image for consistent environments.
-   **JavaScript Web Application**: A client-side resume builder, built with modern JavaScript practices (inferred from Babel/Jest setup).
-   **Unit & Integration Testing**: Comprehensive testing suite powered by Jest to ensure application reliability.
-   **Version Control Integration**: Seamless integration with GitHub for triggering pipeline runs on code pushes.
-   **Dependency Management**: Efficient handling of Node.js dependencies using npm.
-   **Structured Project Layout**: Clear separation of application code, build configurations, and CI/CD scripts.

## 🚀 Quick Start

This project has two main setup paths: setting up the **Resume Builder Application** for local development and configuring the **Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline**.

### 1. Application Development Setup (Local)

To get the resume builder application running locally for development and testing:

#### Prerequisites
-   **Node.js**: Version 18.x or higher (LTS recommended)
-   **npm**: Version 8.x or higher

#### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vinaykumaru2k3/Automated-Resume-Builder-With-Jenkins.git
    cd Automated-Resume-Builder-With-Jenkins
    ```

2.  **Install Node.js dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start development server**
    The `package.json` file defines a `start` script, typically for a development server.
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    *(Note: Without specific `src` content, the exact output and port are inferred. Common ports are 3000, 8080.)*

4.  **Open your browser**
    Visit `http://localhost:[detected_port]` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)

### 2. Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Setup

To set up and run the automated CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins:

#### Prerequisites
-   **Jenkins Server**: A running instance of Jenkins (LTS recommended).
-   **Docker**: Docker Daemon installed and running on the Jenkins agent or server.
-   **Required Jenkins Plugins**: (Inferred from Jenkinsfile)
    -   `Pipeline` (for Declarative Pipeline)
    -   `Docker Pipeline`
    -   `Git`

#### Setup

1.  **Prepare Jenkins Credentials (if needed)**
    If your `Jenkinsfile` pushes to a private Docker registry or deploys to a remote server, ensure you configure the necessary credentials in Jenkins.

2.  **Create a New Jenkins Pipeline Job**
    -   In Jenkins, navigate to `New Item`.
    -   Enter an item name (e.g., `Automated-Resume-Builder-Pipeline`).
    -   Select `Pipeline` and click `OK`.

3.  **Configure the Pipeline Job**
    -   In the job configuration, under `Build Triggers`, enable `GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling` or `Poll SCM` if you want automatic builds on code changes.
    -   Under the `Pipeline` section:
        -   Select `Pipeline script from SCM`.
        -   Set `SCM` to `Git`.
        -   Enter the `Repository URL`: `https://github.com/vinaykumaru2k3/Automated-Resume-Builder-With-Jenkins.git`
        -   Specify `Credentials` if your repository is private.
        -   Set `Branches to build` to `main` (or your target branch).
        -   Ensure `Script Path` is `Jenkinsfile`.

4.  **Save and Run**
    -   Save the Jenkins job configuration.
    -   Click `Build Now` to manually trigger the pipeline for the first time.
    -   Observe the pipeline stages (Clone, Build, Test, Docker Build, etc.) in the Jenkins UI.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
Environment variables are primarily used within the Jenkins pipeline for sensitive information (e.g., Docker registry credentials) or dynamic configurations. For local application development, any `.env.example` or similar would typically be present, but none were detected.

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `DOCKER_HUB_CREDENTIALS` | Jenkins credential ID for Docker Hub login. | N/A | Yes (for Docker push) |
| `DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME` | The name of the Docker image to build. | `resume-builder` | No (can be set in Jenkinsfile) |
| `DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL` | URL of the Docker registry (e.g., `docker.io`). | `docker.io` | No |

### Configuration Files
-   **`.babelrc`**: Configures Babel for JavaScript transpilation, allowing the use of modern JS features and JSX.
-   **`jest.config.js`**: Defines how Jest runs tests, including test environments, coverage settings, and transformations.
-   **`Jenkinsfile`**: The heart of the CI/CD pipeline, defining stages for building, testing, and deploying the application.
-   **`Dockerfile`**: Specifies the steps to create a Docker image of the application.

## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts
The `package.json` file includes the following scripts:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm start` | Starts the development server for the resume builder application. |
| `npm test`  | Executes tests using Jest. |
| `npm run build` | Creates a production-ready build of the application. |

### Development Workflow
1.  Write application code (likely JavaScript modules).
2.  Run `npm start` to see changes in real-time with a local development server.
3.  Write tests in the `tests/` directory.
4.  Run `npm test` to verify functionality.
5.  Commit changes to the `main` branch (or a feature branch) to trigger the Jenkins pipeline.

## 🧪 Testing

This project uses **Jest** for testing its JavaScript components and logic.

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage report
npm test -- --coverage
```

Test files are expected to be located in the `tests/` directory, following typical Jest conventions.

## 🚀 Deployment

The `Jenkinsfile` defines the automated deployment process:

1.  **Checkout**: Fetches the latest code from the Git repository.
2.  **Build**: Installs Node.js dependencies and creates a production build of the web application (`npm install`, `npm run build`).
3.  **Test**: Runs unit and integration tests using Jest (`npm test`).
4.  **Docker Build**: Constructs a Docker image of the application based on the `Dockerfile`.
5.  **Docker Push**: Pushes the newly built Docker image to a specified Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
6.  **Deploy**: (Placeholder in pipeline) This stage would typically involve deploying the Docker image to a production environment (e.g., Kubernetes, a cloud VM, or a dedicated server).

This pipeline ensures that only tested and containerized versions of the application are pushed and made ready for deployment.
